### Develop a committee of deep learning models on the Fashion MNIST dataset and compare their combined performance against individual models, using various metrics including confusion matrices and classification reports
#### Model Development:
- Model 1: shallow neural network
- Model 2: basic convolutional neural network (CNN).
- Model 3: deeper CNN (architecturally different from Model 2).
- committee by averaging predictions of the three models
- enhance model performance: data augmentation
- ensemble techniques: weighted  averaging based committee
