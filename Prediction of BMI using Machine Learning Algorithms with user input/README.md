### BMI Classification Based on Gender, Height, and Weight Using Machine Learning
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- distribution of BMI categories and explore the relationship between gender, height, weight, and BMI category.
- gender-specific distributions for height, weight, and BMI categories.
#### Model Training and Prediction
- Trains classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM and KNN) and make predictions on BMI categories.
- Gender-Specific Modeling: Trains separate models for each gender to evaluate if model performance improves when predicting BMI categories within gender groups
#### Model Evaluation and Comparison
- Uses metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for model evaluation
- Compares model performances across the general and gender-specific models to assess differences in predictive accuracies or other metrics
#### Predicting User Inputs
- Predicts BMI using both generic and gender specific models from command line user input
