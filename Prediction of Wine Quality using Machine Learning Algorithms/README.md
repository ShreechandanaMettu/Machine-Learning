# Prediction of Wine Quality using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical attributes using various machine learning algorithms. The notebook explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Project Structure

- **Notebook**: `Prediction of Wine Quality using Machine Learning Algorithms.ipynb`  
  This Jupyter Notebook contains the entire workflow, including:
  - Data loading and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, etc.)
  - Implementation of machine learning algorithms
  - Evaluation of model performance
  - Insights and conclusions

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains physicochemical properties (e.g., acidity, sugar, pH) of wine samples, along with their quality ratings.  
- **Input Features**: Chemical properties such as alcohol content, pH, and residual sugar.
- **Target Variable**: Wine quality (typically a score between 0-10).

The dataset can be sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) or another similar source.
