### Perform the regression analysis using Boston Housing dataset.
#### Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform a comprehensive EDA on the Boston Housing
dataset. Visualize the distribution of the target variable and important features using histograms,
box plots, and scatter plots.
#### Task 2: Regression Analysis.
- Model Implementation: linear, ridge, lasso, and OLS regression models.
- Model Evaluation: R^2 score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
### Perform the regression analysis using Fish dataset.
#### Task 1: Linear regression.
- predictive linear regression model to estimate weight of the fish from its length, height, and width (the data source fish.csv is provided).
#### Task 2: Ridge and Lasso Regression.
- Fit the Ridge and Lasso Regression Models
